Constrainly - Test Case Generator

Constrainly is a modern web platform for generating constraint-based test cases for competitive programming and algorithm problems. It provides an intuitive interface to define variables with complex relationships and automatically generate valid test data.

ðŸŽ¯ Key Features

    Variable Types: Support for scalars, arrays, matrices, strings, trees, and graphs
    Smart Dependencies: Variables can depend on other variables' runtime values
    Constraint System: Define min/max ranges, relationships, and custom rules
    Visual Dependency Graph: Interactive visualization of variable relationships
    Flexible Output Formats: Customize how test cases are formatted and structured
    Authentication: Secure Google OAuth login with user management
    Database Integration: Persistent storage with Neon PostgreSQL and Redis caching

ðŸ”§ How It Works

    Define Variables: Create variables (n, array, matrix, etc.) with constraints
    Set Dependencies: Link variables so one depends on another's generated value
    Configure Output: Choose how test cases should be formatted
    Generate: Automatically create multiple valid test cases respecting all constraints

ðŸ’¡ Perfect For

    Competitive programming contest preparation
    Algorithm testing and validation
    Educational programming exercises
    Automated test case generation for coding interviews

Built with Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and modern web technologies for a seamless developer experience.
